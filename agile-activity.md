How to do Iteration Planning or IPM?

Step 1 - Set Iteration Goals

    To set the iteration Goal, we need to answer this questions. What is the next goal or the most important problem to solve? What products has most costumer value?

Step 2 - Estimate user stories

    On StoriesOnBoard you can easily add estimation information to your backlog items. You can also use story points and custom estimation units.
    The product manager should involve the lead developer to estimate the user stories so we can have an idea for the team's velocity.

Step 3 - Establish capacity

    It is necessary to check that the proposed iteration meets the deadlines and capacity of the development team.
    You need to check the availability of the team members. We should consider the holidays, sick leaves, training opportunities and etc.

    “Calculating the agile team’s capacity often fails when you don’t check teammate’s availability.”

Step 4 - Planning steps - Internal Priority

    Internal priority management can be key if the iteration contains risky elements such as blockers or integration functions.
    By arranging user stories within an iteration, you can express internal priority and make them more visual by adding labels and tags to the cards.

Step 5 – From stories to tasks

    Splitting user stories allows for a more accurate assessment and estimation of the user story. If the estimated effort changes after tasks are estimated, StoriesOnBoard automatically updates the estimation points in the product backlog.

How to do Kick off (dev kick off with BA and QA)?

    The purpose of user kick of is to align on requirements and to ensure that everyone has what they need to start developing a feature. User story kick-offs are short meetings (10–15 minutes) that developers initiate to align everyone on the team before they start to code a feature.

- Developers will initiate a user story kick-off just before they pick up a ticket and start coding.
- They clarify any questions around the feature they are building and ensure they are aligned with backend implementation.
- They can also go through their interpretation of the acceptance criteria.
- Developers discuss the technical details and implementation strategy.
- QA strategizes how to test with developers and asks for test data.
- QA’s can also present test cases they are planning on testing and get them reviewed by developers.
- This is also a chance to discuss the risks, edge cases, negative cases, test data, and automated tests requirements before implementation.
- Product Owner/BA will ensure that the requirements are understood and aligned.
- Pro tip: Anyone in the user story kick-off can take down notes and post-it in Slack/Jira ticket to ensure no details are forgotten after the meeting.

How to do a desk check(with BA & QA)?

    A desk check is when a developer demos to the team a partial or complete item or module. The goal is to inspect solution fast and do quick changes if necessary.
    Have all the acceptance criteria been met?  Does the output, such as UI screens or reports, match the mock-ups?  Are any bugs encountered during the demo?  If identified at that time, the developer can more easily fix issues in their local environment before it even gets to QA.  Problems found sooner contributes to less bug finding during testing which equates to time saved.
